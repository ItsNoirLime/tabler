tabler
======

Easier translation handling for Arma 3 Mods.

Parse all the stringtable.xml files in every subfolder, edit them and then parse it back with one click of a button. There's no need anymore to open every stringtable.xml file one by one.

### Features
* Open all stringtable.xml files in one UI
* Add keys or edit translations in an Excel-like grid view
* Save all changes back to the stringtable.xml files
